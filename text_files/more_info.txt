FAQ
What does Priority mean?
We recommend using the Priority value to indicate the urgency of a list item. 
For example, a grocery item with High priority may be out of stock and need immediate purchase. 
While a grocery item with low priority may be low on stock and should only be purchased on sale.

Are there plans to add more features?
Yes! We have big plans for this app. Stay tuned!
